1:
    The sequence of path algebras of the linearly oriented A_n quiver. n = 1,...,9

2: LinearAnTModK
    The sequence of algebras KQ/(KQ+)^K, where Q is the "almost linearly oriented" A_n quiver. The first arrow points left, all other arrows point right. (If the first arrow points right, all other arrows point left, then the result is the same.)

3. 
    The sequence of algebras KQ/(KQ+)^K, where Q is the "almost linearly oriented" A_n quiver. The first two arrows point left, all other arrows point right.

4.
    The sequence of algebras KQ/(KQ+)^K, where Q is the "almost linearly oriented" A_n quiver. The first arrow points right, the second arrow points left, all other arrows point right.

5.
    The sequence of canonically oriented algebras with underlying *Euclidean* quiver D_n^~, modulo the square of the radical, ie. KQ/(KQ+)^2
6.
    The sequence of algebras KQ/(KQ+)^K, where Q is the D_n Dynkin quiver. Orient them in four categories. Have 1, 2 both connected to 3.
    a — 1->3->...->n-1, and 2->3
    b — 1->3->...->n-1, and 2<-3
    c — 1<-3<-...<-n-1, and 2->3
    d — 1<-3<-...<-n-1, and 2<-3
	Important: Results for a,d agree, and for b,c.
HENCEFORTH: Store only a,d in 6, and store a under /ModK/
		Store b,c in 6a, and store b under /ModK/
7.
    The sequence of KQ/(KQ+)^K, for Q = A_n
8.
	E_6, E_7, E_8

9.
    Dynkin Quiver + Added relation that composition of arrows in/out of vertex 3 are zero

10.
    Commutative square + A_n/ModK

11.
    Commutative square + A_n/ModK + Added relationship that those arrows crossing through the sink of vertex 4 and into A_n are zero

12.
	Linear A_n / Mod K, but the first relationship (involving the first arrow) is missing.

13. 
	Linear A_n / Mod K, but the first two relationships (involving the first and second arrow) are missing.

14. Dual of commutative square + relations.

15.
	Euclidean A_n quiver, Nakayama algebra / Mod K.
	This doesn't work. Program is not sophisticated enough for these computations.
